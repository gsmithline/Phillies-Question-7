# Phillies-Question-7
- The code for part A is in the function expected_value_single_ticket
- The code for part B is in the function  expected_value_two_tickets

## Note about Approximations:
- For ticket values between $1 and $100, the expected value is approximated using the mean of the distribution. For ticket values above $100, the expected value is approximated using the mean plus the standard deviation and an additional bonus.
- One other method to solve this problem is integrate over the probability density function of the normal distribution for the respective segments. 
- Any questions feel free to reach out!
