# Phillies-Question-7
- The code for part A is in the function expected_value_single_ticket
- The code for part B is in the function  expected_value_two_tickets

## Note about Approximations:
- For ticket values between $1 and $100, the expected value is approximated using the mean of the distribution. For ticket values above $100, the expected value is approximated using the mean plus the standard deviation and an additional bonus. These approximations were made to simplify the calculations and provide a quick estimate. For a more accurate expected value, one would need to integrate over the probability density function of the normal distribution for the respective segments. The provided code offers a close approximation, but for exact values, more detailed calculations involving numerical integration would be necessary.
